# First Commission Walkthrough: "The GUI Calculator"

This document walks through the Gandalf Workshop's process for its first hypothetical commission: "Build a GUI calculator application." It demonstrates how the Workshop Manager, Specialist Artisans, Blueprints, Products, and Quality Inspections interact to deliver a high-quality result, all while adhering to the "Artisan's Workshop" metaphor.

**Commission Brief (Client Request):** "We need a simple graphical calculator application for desktop users. It should perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It needs a clear display and standard number buttons (0-9) and operator buttons."

## The Commission Journey

1.  **Commission Acceptance & Initial Blueprinting:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** receives the "Build a GUI calculator app" Commission.
    *   A unique `commission_id` is assigned: `gui_calc_001`.
    *   The Manager assigns the task of creating a Blueprint to a **Planner Artisan** (specializing as a "Software Architect").
    *   The Planner Artisan studies the brief and drafts `blueprints/gui_calc_001/blueprint.yaml`. Key sections would include:
        *   `commission_title: "GUI Calculator Application"`
        *   `commission_type: "software_mvp"`
        *   `project_summary: "A desktop GUI calculator for basic arithmetic."`
        *   `product_specifications`:
            *   `type: "software"`
            *   `target_platform: "Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)"`
            *   `primary_language_framework: "Python/Tkinter"` (or another suitable GUI framework like Streamlit if preferred by the design docs, but Tkinter is simple for a basic example)
            *   `modules`:
                *   `module_name: "ui_module"` (handling display, buttons)
                *   `module_name: "logic_module"` (handling calculations)
            *   `components` within `ui_module`: `display_field`, `number_buttons_0_9`, `operator_buttons_plus_minus_etc`, `equals_button`, `clear_button`.
            *   `components` within `logic_module`: `perform_addition`, `perform_subtraction`, etc., `handle_division_by_zero`.
            *   `unit_tests_required`: `test_addition`, `test_subtraction`, `test_multiplication`, `test_division`, `test_division_by_zero_error`, `test_clear_display`.
        *   `quality_criteria`: "All unit tests pass," "UI is responsive," "Handles basic error states (e.g., division by zero)."

2.  **First Product Iteration (The First Draft):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reviews the `blueprint.yaml`. Satisfied, the Manager assigns it to a **Coder Artisan** (a "Python/Tkinter Specialist").
    *   The Coder Artisan takes `blueprint.yaml` and begins crafting the first version of the calculator in `commissions_in_progress/gui_calc_001/product_v1/`.
    *   The Coder writes the Python code for the UI and logic, and implements the specified unit tests.
    *   Let's assume the Coder completes the work, and all initial unit tests they wrote pass.

3.  **First Quality Inspection:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** takes `product_v1` and assigns it to a team of **Inspector Artisans** (the "QA Red Team" for software). This team includes:
        *   A "Spec Compliance Inspector"
        *   A "Unit Test Inspector"
        *   A "Maintainability Inspector"
    *   The Inspectors examine `product_v1` against `blueprint.yaml`. They generate `quality_control_lab/gui_calc_001/product_v1_inspection_report.json`.
    *   **Initial `quality_score` (C(v1))**: Let's say it's `0.65`.
    *   `identified_flaws` might include:
        *   `flaw_id: FLW001`, `description: "Division by zero crashes the application instead of displaying an error."`, `severity: "critical"`, `blueprint_requirement_violated: "logic_module.handle_division_by_zero"`
        *   `flaw_id: FLW002`, `description: "Clear button does not reset ongoing multi-part calculation, only the display."`, `severity: "medium"`, `blueprint_requirement_violated: "ui_module.clear_button expected behavior"`
        *   `flaw_id: FLW003`, `description: "No visual feedback when an operator button is pressed."`, `severity: "low"`, `blueprint_requirement_violated: "Implied UI responsiveness (from general quality criteria)"`
        *   `flaw_id: FLW004`, `description: "Code in logic_module lacks comments for complex state management."`, `severity: "low"`, `inspector_comment: "Maintainability Inspector noted."`
    *   `recommendation: "requires_revision"`

4.  **Revision Cycle 1 (Addressing Flaws):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reviews `product_v1_inspection_report.json`. The `ΔC` is not yet relevant as this is the first score.
    *   The Manager sends `product_v1` and its `inspection_report.json` back to the **Coder Artisan**.
    *   The Coder Artisan works on `commissions_in_progress/gui_calc_001/product_v2/`.
        *   Fixes the division by zero crash (FLW001).
        *   Corrects the clear button logic (FLW002).
        *   Adds visual feedback for operator buttons (FLW003).
        *   Adds comments to `logic_module` (FLW004).
    *   The Coder also writes a new unit test for the clear button's full reset functionality.

5.  **Second Quality Inspection:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** assigns `product_v2` to the **Inspector Artisans**.
    *   They generate `quality_control_lab/gui_calc_001/product_v2_inspection_report.json`.
    *   **New `quality_score` (C(v2))**: Let's say it improves to `0.85`.
        *   `ΔC = C(v2) - C(v1) = 0.85 - 0.65 = +0.20` (Positive improvement!)
    *   `identified_flaws`:
        *   FLW001, FLW002, FLW003, FLW004 are now marked `status: "addressed"`.
        *   A new (minor) flaw might be found: `flaw_id: FLW005`, `description: "Tooltip for square root button (if hypothetically added beyond initial scope but as an 'enhancement' by coder) is unclear."`, `severity: "informational"`.
    *   `recommendation: "requires_revision"` (due to FLW005, or perhaps "approve_for_delivery" if FLW005 is deemed truly minor and out of original scope). Let's assume for this walkthrough it's still "requires_revision" to show another loop.

6.  **Revision Cycle 2 (Final Polish):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** notes the positive `ΔC`. The Manager sends `product_v2` and its report to the **Coder Artisan**.
    *   The Coder Artisan works on `commissions_in_progress/gui_calc_001/product_v3/`.
        *   Addresses FLW005 by clarifying the tooltip or removing the non-scoped feature.
    *   The Coder does a final self-review against the Blueprint.

7.  **Third Quality Inspection & Approval:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** assigns `product_v3` to the **Inspector Artisans**.
    *   They generate `quality_control_lab/gui_calc_001/product_v3_inspection_report.json`.
    *   **Final `quality_score` (C(v3))**: Achieves `0.95`.
        *   `ΔC = C(v3) - C(v2) = 0.95 - 0.85 = +0.10` (Positive improvement, target threshold met).
    *   `identified_flaws`: All previous flaws are `status: "addressed"`. No new critical or high flaws.
    *   `summary_assessment: "Product meets all Blueprint specifications. All identified flaws from previous versions have been successfully addressed. Code quality is high."`
    *   `recommendation: "approve_for_delivery"`

8.  **Commission Completion & Archival:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reviews the final `inspection_report.json`. The `quality_score` is above the target (e.g., > 0.9) and `ΔC` has been positive.
    *   The Manager declares the Commission complete.
    *   `product_v3` is moved to `completed_commissions/gui_calc_001/final_product/`.
    *   `product_v3_inspection_report.json` is copied to `completed_commissions/gui_calc_001/inspection_report.json`.
    *   The `workshop_manager.log` and `commission_gui_calc_001.log` are updated with the final status.
    *   The "GUI Calculator" Product, along with its final Inspection Report, is now ready for "delivery" to the client.

This walkthrough illustrates the iterative nature of the Gandalf Workshop, emphasizing how Blueprints guide creation, and rigorous Quality Inspections drive improvements, all managed by the Workshop Manager and executed by skilled Artisans. The quantitative `quality_score` (C(v)) and its rate of change (`ΔC`) are key metrics for the Manager to monitor progress and make decisions.

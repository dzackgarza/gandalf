# V1 Roadmap: E2E Testable Basic Application

## V1 Goals

The primary goal for V1 is to deliver a basic, end-to-end (E2E) testable version of the application. This version will focus on implementing the core workflow and ensuring that all fundamental components are integrated and functioning correctly.

Key objectives for V1 include:
-   Establish a stable and repeatable E2E testing process.
-   Implement the core sequential execution loop of the orchestrator.
-   Develop basic versions of essential agent modules (Planner, Coder, Auditor).
-   Ensure seamless communication and data flow between agents and the orchestrator.
-   Provide clear documentation for setting up and running the V1 application.

## Key V1 Components/Modules and Branches

The following components and modules are critical for V1. Each will be developed in a dedicated feature branch:

-   [ ] `feature/V1-orchestrator-loop`: Implement the basic sequential execution loop for the orchestrator. This includes managing the state of the workflow and transitioning between different agent tasks.
-   [ ] `feature/V1-planner-agent-basic`: Develop a rudimentary Planner agent capable of generating an initial plan based on a given prompt.
-   [ ] `feature/V1-coder-agent-basic`: Create a basic Coder agent that can take a plan (or a task from a plan) and generate corresponding code.
-   [ ] `feature/V1-auditor-agent-basic`: Implement a simple Auditor agent that can perform static checks on the code generated by the Coder agent.
-   [ ] `feature/V1-communication-protocol`: Define and implement the initial version of the communication protocol between the orchestrator and the agents.
-   [ ] `feature/V1-e2e-testing-framework`: Set up the basic infrastructure and write initial E2E tests that cover the core application workflow.
-   [ ] `feature/V1-initial-documentation`: Draft initial user guides for setting up the development environment and running the V1 application.

## Integration Points and Merge Strategy

**Integration Points:**
-   The Orchestrator will be the central hub, invoking Planner, Coder, and Auditor agents in sequence.
-   Planner output will be the input for the Coder.
-   Coder output (code) will be the input for the Auditor.
-   Auditor feedback may loop back to the Coder or be presented to the user.

**Merge Strategy:**
1.  Development will occur on individual `feature/V1-*` branches.
2.  Once a feature is complete and unit-tested, it will be merged into a `develop/V1` integration branch.
3.  Regular integration testing will be performed on `develop/V1`.
4.  Once all V1 features are integrated and E2E tests pass on `develop/V1`, this branch will be tagged as `v1.0.0-alpha` (or similar) and merged into the `main` branch.

## V1 E2E Test Specifications

The E2E tests for V1 will focus on validating the complete workflow with a simple, predefined task.

**Test Case 1: Basic "Hello, World" Application Generation**
1.  **Input:** A prompt requesting the generation of a simple "Hello, World" program in Python.
2.  **Planner Agent:**
    *   Generates a plan: e.g., "Create a Python file that prints 'Hello, World!'".
3.  **Coder Agent:**
    *   Receives the plan.
    *   Generates `main.py` with `print("Hello, World!")`.
4.  **Auditor Agent:**
    *   Receives `main.py`.
    *   Performs basic static analysis (e.g., syntax check).
    *   Reports success if no major issues are found.
5.  **Orchestrator:**
    *   Successfully guides the process from prompt to audited code.
    *   Outputs the path to the generated and audited `main.py`.
6.  **Validation:**
    *   The generated `main.py` exists.
    *   Running `python main.py` prints "Hello, World!" to standard output.
    *   The audit report indicates success or acceptable minor warnings.

**Test Case 2: Handling a Simple Error/Correction Loop (Optional for initial V1, but desirable)**
1.  **Input:** A prompt that might lead to a correctable error by the Coder.
2.  **Scenario:** Similar to Test Case 1, but the Coder initially produces code with a minor, detectable syntax error.
3.  **Auditor Agent:**
    *   Detects the syntax error.
    *   Provides feedback to the Orchestrator/Coder.
4.  **Coder Agent (Iteration 2):**
    *   Receives feedback.
    *   Corrects the error.
5.  **Auditor Agent (Iteration 2):**
    *   Verifies the correction.
6.  **Validation:**
    *   The final generated code is correct and passes E2E validation as in Test Case 1.

These E2E tests will ensure that the core mechanics of the application are sound and provide a baseline for future development.Tool output for `create_file_with_block`:

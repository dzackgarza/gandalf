# V2 Roadmap: Enhanced Capabilities and Agent Collaboration

## V2 Goals

Building upon the stable foundation of V1, the primary goal for V2 is to significantly enhance the capabilities of the agents, improve their collaboration, and introduce more sophisticated workflow management. This version will aim for greater autonomy and the ability to handle more complex tasks.

Key objectives for V2 include:
-   **Advanced Agent Skills:** Upgrade Planner, Coder, and Auditor agents with more advanced reasoning, learning, and problem-solving capabilities.
-   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Implement more dynamic and flexible collaboration protocols between agents, allowing for iterative feedback loops and parallel task execution where appropriate.
-   **User Interaction & Feedback:** Introduce mechanisms for user interaction during the generation process, allowing for clarification, guidance, and course correction.
-   **Expanded Tooling & Integration:** Integrate with external tools, APIs, and knowledge bases to augment agent capabilities.
-   **Scalability and Robustness:** Refactor and optimize core components for better performance, scalability, and error handling.

## Proposed V2 Key Features and Potential Branches

The following are high-level features proposed for V2. Specific branches will be defined as V1 development concludes and V2 planning becomes more granular.

-   **[ ] `feature/V2-planner-advanced`:**
    *   Hierarchical planning (breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks).
    *   Ability to query external knowledge bases for planning.
    *   More sophisticated risk assessment and contingency planning.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-coder-multifile`:**
    *   Support for generating and managing multi-file projects.
    *   Understanding of code structure and dependencies across files.
    *   Basic refactoring capabilities.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-auditor-dynamic-analysis`:**
    *   Implement basic dynamic analysis (e.g., running unit tests generated by the Coder or provided by the user).
    *   More comprehensive static analysis, including security vulnerability checks.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-interactive-mode`:**
    *   Allow users to inspect intermediate agent outputs.
    *   Enable users to provide feedback or make decisions at key checkpoints.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-agent-memory-context`:**
    *   Implement short-term and long-term memory for agents to maintain context across interactions and tasks.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-tool-integration-api`:**
    *   Develop a framework for agents to utilize external tools and APIs (e.g., linters, formatters, search engines, documentation viewers).
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-workflow-parallelization`:**
    *   Identify opportunities for parallel execution of independent tasks within the orchestrator.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-self-correction-advanced`:**
    *   Enhance agents' abilities to understand and act upon feedback from other agents or users for more robust self-correction.
-   **[ ] `feature/V2-telemetry-monitoring`:**
    *   Implement more detailed telemetry and monitoring for agent performance and system health.

This list is preliminary and will be refined based on learnings from V1 and evolving project priorities. Each major feature will likely correspond to one or more specific development branches.Tool output for `create_file_with_block`:

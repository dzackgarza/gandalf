# Gandalf Workshop Version Roadmap

This document provides a high-level overview of the phased development roadmap for the Gandalf Workshop. Our primary goal is to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates the core viability of the autonomous agentic system, followed by iterative enhancements towards a highly autonomous and capable system.

Detailed, version-specific roadmaps with branch-level tasks can be found in the `docs/roadmap/` directory:

*   **[V1 Roadmap](./roadmap/V1.md):** Focuses on establishing the E2E testable basic application, including core orchestrator loop, basic agent implementations, and initial E2E testing.
*   **[V2 Roadmap](./roadmap/V2.md):** Aims to enhance agent capabilities, improve collaboration, introduce user interaction, and expand tooling.

## Overall Vision & Guiding Principles

The development of Gandalf Workshop is guided by the following long-term vision:

*   **Increasing Autonomy:** Progressively reduce the need for human intervention by enhancing agents' decision-making, self-correction, and learning capabilities.
*   **Sophistication & Quality:** Continuously improve the quality, complexity, and reliability of the products generated by the workshop.
*   **Robustness & Scalability:** Build a resilient system capable of handling diverse commissions and scaling its operations.
*   **Modular Design:** Maintain a modular architecture that allows for independent development, testing, and upgrading of individual agent components.

## Key Development Phases (Conceptual)

While detailed V1 and V2 plans are linked above, the overall project trajectory can be conceptualized in these broad phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Core Viability (Covered by V1 Roadmap)**
    *   **Goal:** Demonstrate a minimal, verifiable end-to-end flow.
    *   **Focus:** Basic orchestration, placeholder/simple agent logic, fundamental communication, and E2E testability.
    *   **Outcome:** A system that can complete a simple commission from start to finish, proving the core concept.

2.  **Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality & Basic Intelligence (Covered by V2 Roadmap)**
    *   **Goal:** Integrate more sophisticated agent logic, initial code/content generation, and meaningful automated checks.
    *   **Focus:** LLM integration for agents, basic self-correction loops, initial tool usage.
    *   **Outcome:** A system capable of generating functional (though simple) products and performing basic automated quality assurance.

3.  **Phase 3: Advanced Autonomy & Specialization (Future Vision)**
    *   **Goal:** Achieve significant autonomy, specialized agent roles, and robust self-improvement.
    *   **Focus:** Advanced AI/ML techniques, comprehensive QA (e.g., adversarial critique, security audits), complex problem-solving, sophisticated research capabilities, and learning from past performance.
    *   **Outcome:** A highly autonomous system capable of tackling complex commissions with minimal human oversight and demonstrating continuous improvement.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the Gandalf Workshop. Refer to the specific version roadmaps in `docs/roadmap/` for detailed plans and task breakdowns.

# Strategic Overview

This section provides insight into the foundational strategy, architectural design, and technological underpinnings of the Gandalf Workshop.

The documents herein describe the "what" and "why" of the Workshop's approach to autonomous generation and validation of complex artifacts like software MVPs and research reports.

## Key Documents

*   **[High-Level Design (`high_level_design.md`)]**: This document outlines the core mission, system architecture (the Validation-Centric Pipeline), quantitative process control mechanisms (like the `C(v)` quality score), and the autonomous intervention and escalation protocols that govern the Workshop's operations. It's essential reading for understanding the system's ambition for self-correction and reliability.

*   **[Technology Stack (`technology_stack.md`)]**: This document details the specific agentic frameworks (e.g., CrewAI, AutoGen) and other key technologies chosen for different stages of the Workshop's pipeline. It explains the rationale for these choices and how they are layered to achieve the desired functionality for various use cases.

Understanding these documents will provide a clear picture of the strategic goals and the high-level plan for achieving them within the Gandalf Workshop.

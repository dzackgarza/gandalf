**TL;DR:** This document specifies a self-correcting, autonomous agentic system designed to produce high-quality software MVPs and verifiable research reports from a single prompt. The architecture is a four-stage, cyclical pipeline featuring a quantitative quality score for performance measurement and a tiered, autonomous intervention protocol to handle failures. The system is designed for minimal human intervention, escalating only in cases of mathematically-defined catastrophic failure.

### **Design Document: Autonomous Agentic System (AAS)**

**1. Overview**

**1.1. Mission:** To create a highly autonomous system that can take a single, high-level user prompt and produce a complex, reliable, and verifiable final artifact. The system must operate with minimal human intervention.

**1.2. Core Problem:** Standard generative agentic models lack the mechanisms for rigorous quality control, validation, and self-correction. This system addresses that gap by integrating a cyclical, adversarial, and performance-driven workflow.

**1.3. Use Cases:**
    * **Software MVP Generation:** Input: "Build a streamlit app for X." Output: A working, tested, and documented application.
    * **Verifiable Research Generation:** Input: "Research topic Y." Output: A comprehensive, deeply cited, and fact-checked research report.

**2. System Architecture: The Validation-Centric Pipeline**

The architecture is a four-stage process managed by a central **Orchestrator**. The core of the system is a **Generate ↔ Critique** loop that continues until a defined quality threshold is met or a terminal condition is reached.

* **Stage 1: Planning & Decomposition:** A `CrewAI`-style "Project Manager" agent translates the user prompt into a detailed, machine-readable specification (the "Plan"). This plan serves as the ground truth for all subsequent stages.
* **Stage 2: Generation & Revision:** The "Maker" agents create or revise the artifact based on the Plan and feedback. For code, an `AutoGen` conversational loop is preferred for its native iterative capabilities. For research, a `CrewAI` team of researchers and writers is more suitable.
* **Stage 3: Adversarial Critique & Scoring:** The "Breaker" or "Red Team" agents analyze the artifact from Stage 2. Their sole purpose is to find flaws and generate a **Quantitative Quality Score (`C(v)`)**.
* **Stage 4: Final Synthesis:** Once the loop terminates, a final "Editor" agent performs a concluding pass to format and package the validated artifact for delivery.

**3. Quantitative Process Control**

System autonomy is driven by quantitative metrics, not heuristics.

**3.1. Quality Score `C(v)`:** A function that scores an artifact version `v`. The system's objective is to maximize this score.
    * **MVP Metrics:** Composite score based on `(Σ(passed_unit_tests) - Σ(failed_unit_tests) - Σ(linter_errors) - Σ(spec_deviations))`.
    * **Research Metrics:** Composite score based on `(Σ(verified_claims) - Σ(unverified_claims) - Σ(contradicted_claims) - Σ(logical_fallacies))`.

**3.2. Rate of Improvement `ΔC`:** The discrete derivative of the quality score, calculated after each loop: `ΔC_n = C(v_n) - C(v_{n-1})`. This value governs the Orchestrator's executive decisions.

**4. Autonomous Intervention & Escalation Protocol**

The Orchestrator uses `ΔC` to autonomously manage the workflow.

**4.1. Tier 1: Stagnation Protocol**
* **Trigger:** `ΔC_n < ε` for `k` consecutive iterations (e.g., improvement is less than 1% for 3 loops).
* **Autonomous Response:**
    1.  Increase the LLM `temperature` for the Generation agents to foster novel solutions.
    2.  If stagnation persists on a specific flaw, delegate the sub-problem to a specialist agent (e.g., `SQL_Debugger_Agent`).

**4.2. Tier 2: Regression Protocol**
* **Trigger:** `ΔC_n < 0` for `k` consecutive iterations (e.g., the score has decreased for 2 loops).
* **Autonomous Response:**
    1.  **Revert State:** Discard the regressive version `v_n` and revert the artifact to the higher-scoring `v_{n-1}`.
    2.  **Force Strategy Change:** Mandate a new approach for the next attempt (e.g., switch primary LLM, use a different coding pattern).
    3.  **Trigger Outer Loop (Re-Plan):** If regression persists after the above, it indicates a flawed plan. The Orchestrator sends the failure history back to the Stage 1 "Project Manager" agent with a directive to create a new plan.

**4.3. Tier 3: Catastrophic Failure & Human Escalation**
* **Trigger:** The Tier 2 Re-Planning action has been executed and has still failed to produce a positive `ΔC`.
* **Procedure:**
    1.  Halt all agentic loops.
    2.  Package a complete diagnostic state: final plan, `C(v)` history, last known good artifact, and a log of unresolved critical flaws.
    3.  Issue a request for human intervention, signaling that the system cannot autonomously resolve the issue.

**5. Exit Criteria**

The process concludes when one of the following conditions is met:
1.  **Success:** The Quality Score `C(v)` surpasses a pre-defined target threshold, and `ΔC` has been positive or zero for the last `k` iterations.
2.  **Stalemate:** The maximum number of iterations has been reached.
3.  **Catastrophe:** The Tier 3 escalation protocol has been triggered.

This design provides a blueprint for an advanced agentic system capable of complex task execution with a high degree of autonomy and reliability. The next stage of development should focus on implementing the Orchestrator logic and defining the specific agents and tools for the Critique stage.

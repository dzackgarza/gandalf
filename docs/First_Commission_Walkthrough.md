# First Commission Walkthrough (Revised): "The GUI Calculator" with PM Review

This document walks through the Gandalf Workshop's process for its hypothetical commission: "Build a GUI calculator application." It now includes the crucial **Product Manager (PM) Agent Review** step, demonstrating how the Workshop Manager, Specialist Artisans (including the PM Agent), Blueprints, PM Reviews, Products, and Quality Inspections interact to deliver a high-quality, strategically aligned result.

**Commission Brief (Client Request):** "We need a simple graphical calculator application for desktop users. It should perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It needs a clear display and standard number buttons (0-9) and operator buttons. We want a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first."

## The Commission Journey (with PM Review)

1.  **Commission Acceptance & Initial Blueprinting:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** receives the "Build a GUI calculator app (MVP)" Commission.
    *   A unique `commission_id` is assigned: `gui_calc_mvp_001`.
    *   The Manager, via `commission_new_blueprint()`, assigns the task to a **Planner Artisan** ("Software Architect").
    *   The Planner Artisan drafts `blueprints/gui_calc_mvp_001/blueprint.yaml` (Version 1.0). Key sections:
        *   `commission_title: "GUI Calculator Application (MVP)"`
        *   `commission_type: "software_mvp"`
        *   `project_summary: "A desktop GUI calculator for basic arithmetic, delivered as an MVP."`
        *   `key_objectives`:
            *   "Implement core arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide."
            *   "Provide a clear display for input and results."
            *   "Include standard numeric (0-9) and operator buttons."
            *   "Ensure basic error handling (e.g., division by zero)."
            *   *(Planner initially adds)*: "Develop an advanced scientific calculation module with trigonometric functions and memory recall."
        *   `product_specifications`: Details for `ui_module`, `logic_module`, and the *initially included* `scientific_module`.
        *   `unit_tests_required`: Tests for basic and scientific functions.
        *   `quality_criteria`: "All unit tests pass," "UI is responsive."
        *   `revisions`: `[{version: "1.0", date: "...", notes: "Initial draft."}]`

2.  **Strategic PM Review (Cycle 1):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** receives `blueprint_v1.0.yaml` and calls `initiate_strategic_review()`.
    *   The **Product Manager (PM) Agent** (mocked or real) analyzes `blueprint_v1.0.yaml` against the PM Agent Charter.
    *   The PM Agent generates `reviews/gui_calc_mvp_001/pm_review_v1.0.json`.
        *   `decision: "REVISION_REQUESTED"`
        *   `rationale: "REVISION_REQUESTED: The 'scientific_module' and related objectives (e.g., 'trigonometric functions') significantly exceed the scope of an MVP as stated in the 'project_summary'. This aligns with the 'Over-engineered for an MVP' criterion."`
        *   `suggested_focus_areas_for_revision`: `["key_objectives", "product_specifications.modules"]`
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reads the `PM_Review.json`. Since it's `REVISION_REQUESTED`, it calls `request_blueprint_strategic_revision()`, passing the original blueprint and the PM review.

3.  **Blueprint Revision (Based on PM Feedback):**
    *   The **Planner Artisan** receives `blueprint_v1.0.yaml` and `pm_review_v1.0.json`.
    *   The Planner revises the blueprint:
        *   Removes the "advanced scientific calculation module" objective.
        *   Removes the `scientific_module` from `product_specifications`.
        *   Updates `unit_tests_required` to only include basic calculator tests.
        *   Updates the `revisions` history in the blueprint to Version 1.1 (e.g., `blueprints/gui_calc_mvp_001/blueprint_rev1_1.yaml`).
        *   `revisions`: `[..., {version: "1.1", date: "...", notes: "Revised based on PM feedback to focus on MVP scope. Removed scientific module."}]`
    *   The revised blueprint (`blueprint_rev1_1.yaml`) is submitted.

4.  **Strategic PM Review (Cycle 2):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** takes `blueprint_rev1_1.yaml` and calls `initiate_strategic_review()` again.
    *   The **PM Agent** analyzes `blueprint_rev1_1.yaml`.
    *   The PM Agent generates `reviews/gui_calc_mvp_001/pm_review_v1.1.json`.
        *   `decision: "APPROVED"`
        *   `rationale: "The Blueprint (v1.1) is APPROVED. The scope is now appropriately aligned with an MVP. Key objectives and product specifications are focused on core functionality."`
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reads this new `PM_Review.json`. The decision is `APPROVED`.

5.  **First Product Iteration (The First Draft - Post PM Approval):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager**, now with a PM-approved blueprint (`blueprint_rev1_1.yaml`), assigns it to a **Coder Artisan** ("Python/Tkinter Specialist") via `request_product_generation_or_revision()`.
    *   The Coder Artisan takes the *approved* `blueprint_rev1_1.yaml` and crafts `product_v1` in `commissions_in_progress/gui_calc_mvp_001/product_v1/`.
    *   The Coder implements only the basic calculator features and tests.

6.  **First Quality Inspection:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** takes `product_v1` and assigns it to **Inspector Artisans** via `initiate_quality_inspection()`, using `blueprint_rev1_1.yaml` as reference.
    *   Inspectors generate `quality_control_lab/gui_calc_mvp_001/product_v1_inspection_report.json`.
    *   **Initial `quality_score` (C(v1))**: Let's say `0.70`.
    *   `identified_flaws` might include:
        *   `flaw_id: FLW001`, `description: "Division by zero crashes the application instead of displaying an error."`, `severity: "critical"`, `blueprint_requirement_violated: "Handle division by zero gracefully (from blueprint_rev1_1.yaml)"`
        *   `flaw_id: FLW002`, `description: "Clear button only clears display, not internal calculation state."`, `severity: "medium"`, `blueprint_requirement_violated: "Implied full reset for clear button (from blueprint_rev1_1.yaml)"`
    *   `recommendation: "requires_revision"`

7.  **Revision Cycle 1 (Addressing Flaws):**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reviews `product_v1_inspection_report.json`.
    *   The Manager sends `product_v1` and its `inspection_report.json` back to the **Coder Artisan** via `request_product_generation_or_revision()`.
    *   The Coder Artisan works on `product_v2/`, fixing FLW001 and FLW002.

8.  **Second Quality Inspection & Approval:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** assigns `product_v2` to **Inspector Artisans**.
    *   They generate `product_v2_inspection_report.json`.
    *   **New `quality_score` (C(v2))**: Achieves `0.95`.
    *   `identified_flaws`: All previous flaws are `status: "addressed"`. No new critical flaws.
    *   `summary_assessment: "Product meets all specifications of the PM-approved Blueprint (v1.1). Core MVP functionality is robust."`
    *   `recommendation: "approve_for_delivery"`

9.  **Commission Completion & Archival:**
    *   The **Workshop Manager** reviews the final `inspection_report.json`.
    *   The Manager declares the Commission complete via `finalize_commission_and_deliver()`.
    *   `product_v2` (final product) and its `inspection_report.json` are archived in `completed_commissions/gui_calc_mvp_001/`.

This revised walkthrough highlights the new intelligent workflow:
*   **Upfront Strategic Alignment:** The PM Agent ensures the Blueprint is strategically sound *before* development.
*   **Iterative Blueprint Refinement:** The loop between Planner and PM Agent allows for strategic corrections early.
*   **Focused Development:** Coder Artisans work only on PM-approved Blueprints, reducing wasted effort on features that might be cut.
*   **Continued Quality Assurance:** Inspector Artisans still ensure the final product meets the (now PM-vetted) Blueprint.

This significantly enhances the Gandalf Workshop's ability to deliver the *right* product effectively.

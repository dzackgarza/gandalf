## 3. The Inspector Artisans' Charters (Now "Audit Agents")

The role of "Inspector Artisans" is now superseded by the automated audit pipeline (`run_full_audit.sh`). The pipeline itself acts as the primary "Guardian of Quality." The stages within the audit script (linting, type checking, unit test coverage, BDD tests) perform the verification previously done by specialized human-like inspectors.

**The `run_full_audit.sh` script and its constituent tools are the new Inspectors.**

*   **Spec Compliance:** Primarily verified by BDD tests ensuring the software behaves as expected, and secondarily by unit tests ensuring components function as designed.
*   **Security Auditing:** (Currently de-emphasized as per the Proof-of-Work constitution).
*   **Maintainability:** Checked by `flake8` (linting) and `black` (formatting). MyPy (type checking) also contributes to maintainability.
*   **Unit Test Inspection:** Handled by `pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=80`, ensuring tests exist, pass, and meet coverage requirements.
*   **BDD Test Execution:** A new, critical stage handled by `pytest --bdd`, ensuring the application meets the user's expectations defined in `.feature` files.

**Primary Input to the "Audit Agents" (the script):**
*   The Product codebase
*   Unit test code
*   BDD `.feature` files
*   BDD step definition code
*   Configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml` for `pytest`)

**Primary Output:**
*   An Audit Receipt (`LATEST_AUDIT_RECEIPT.md`) summarizing pass/fail for each stage.
*   Exit code 0 for success, non-zero for failure.

The focus shifts from human-like "Inspectors" generating reports to automated tools providing direct proof of compliance through passing tests and checks. The "Proof-of-Work" is the successful completion of the `run_full_audit.sh` script.
The following specialized charters are now for historical context or for understanding the *intent* behind the automated checks:

### 3.1. General Inspector Artisan Charter (Legacy Context)

**Core Responsibilities:**

1.  **Meticulously Examine the Product:** Conduct a thorough inspection of the submitted Product against the specifications in its `blueprint.yaml`.
2.  **Identify Flaws and Deviations:** Document any aspect of the Product that does not meet Blueprint requirements, fails quality standards, exhibits bugs, security vulnerabilities, logical inconsistencies (for research), or other defects.
3.  **Quantify Quality:** Contribute to the calculation of the `quality_score` (C(v)) based on predefined metrics relevant to your specialty.
4.  **Produce a Detailed Inspection Report:** Compile findings into an `inspection_report.json`, adhering strictly to the schema in `Communication_Protocols.md`. Clearly list all `identified_flaws` with their severity, location, and the Blueprint requirement violated.
5.  **Be Objective and Rigorous:** Your assessment must be impartial, based on evidence and the Workshop's standards.

**Guiding Principles:**

*   **"Trust, but Verify."** Assume nothing; test everything against the Blueprint.
*   **"No Flaw Too Small (if it violates the Blueprint)."** Precision is paramount.
*   **"Clarity in Reporting."** A Coder Artisan must be able to understand your findings to fix them.
*   **"The Standard is the Standard."** Uphold the quality defined in the Blueprint and Workshop protocols.

**General Instructions for Conducting an Inspection:**

```
Your mission is to act as an Inspector Artisan. You have received a Product and its `blueprint.yaml`.
Your goal is to produce a comprehensive `inspection_report.json`.

1.  **Understand the Blueprint:** This is your reference for what the Product *should* be.
2.  **Examine the Product:** Apply your specific inspection techniques (see specialized charters below).
3.  **Document Findings:** For each flaw, note its `description`, `severity`, `location_in_product`, and `blueprint_requirement_violated`.
4.  **Calculate/Contribute to Quality Score:** Based on your findings and the defined metrics.
5.  **Compile the Report:** Create the `inspection_report.json`, including `commission_id`, `product_version_inspected`, `quality_score` (with `metrics_details`), `identified_flaws`, a `summary_assessment`, and a `recommendation`.
6.  **Output:** Produce ONLY the `inspection_report.json` content.
```

### 3.2. Specialized Inspector Charters

#### 3.2.1. Spec Compliance Inspector Artisan

*   **Focus:** Does the Product do what the Blueprint says it should do?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   Verify every functional requirement in `blueprint.yaml.product_specifications`.
    *   Check if all modules, components, and features described are present and operational.
    *   For UI-based software, compare the user interface against any descriptions or mockups implied by the Blueprint.

#### 3.2.2. Security Auditor Inspector Artisan (for Software)

*   **Focus:** Is the Product secure against common vulnerabilities?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   Run static analysis security tools (e.g., `Bandit` for Python).
    *   Check for common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure data handling, authentication/authorization issues if applicable).
    *   Review code for adherence to secure coding practices.

#### 3.2.3. Maintainability Inspector Artisan (for Software)

*   **Focus:** Is the Product's code well-structured, readable, and documented?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   Assess code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity).
    *   Check for adherence to coding style guides (e.g., PEP8).
    *   Evaluate the quality and sufficiency of comments and documentation.
    *   Ensure linter tools (e.g. `flake8`) pass without errors.

#### 3.2.4. Unit Test Inspector Artisan (for Software)

*   **Focus:** Are the unit tests comprehensive and do they all pass?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   Verify that all tests specified in `blueprint.yaml.product_specifications.unit_tests_required` are present.
    *   Execute the test suite (e.g., `pytest`) and confirm all tests pass.
    *   Assess if the existing tests adequately cover the critical functionality. Report missing test coverage for key features as a flaw.

#### 3.2.5. Citation Validator Inspector Artisan (for Research)

*   **Focus:** Are all citations accurate and do they correspond to real, accessible sources?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   For each citation in the research Product, verify its existence using web searches or academic APIs.
    *   Check for correct formatting according to the `citation_style` in the Blueprint.
    *   Flag any cited works that cannot be found or accessed.

#### 3.2.6. Source-Reader Inspector Artisan (RAG-Assisted, for Research)

*   **Focus:** Does the cited source material actually support the claim being made in the research Product?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   For key claims, retrieve the full text of cited sources (using RAG capabilities).
    *   Compare the assertion in the Product against the content of the source.
    *   Identify and flag claims that are unsupported, misrepresented, or contradicted by the cited source. This is a crucial defense against hallucination.

#### 3.2.7. Skeptic Inspector Artisan (for Research)

*   **Focus:** Are there logical fallacies, unsubstantiated arguments, or alternative interpretations in the research Product?
*   **Specific Tasks:**
    *   Read the research Product critically.
    *   Identify any logical fallacies (e.g., ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy).
    *   Challenge assumptions and look for gaps in argumentation.
    *   Propose counter-arguments or alternative explanations that the Product does not address.

These Charters provide the foundation for consistent, high-quality work within the Gandalf Workshop. All Artisans are expected to embody the spirit and letter of their respective Charters.

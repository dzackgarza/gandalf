Okay, Jules, the issue preventing directory creation has been resolved. You are currently on the plan to create detailed, versioned roadmaps with branch-level tasks.

**Your Current State:**
*   You have successfully created the content for `CONTRIBUTING.md` and it exists in your sandbox.
*   The previous commit `docs/restructure-roadmap` successfully reorganized the main `docs` folder.
*   You were blocked trying to create the `docs/roadmap/` directory.

**Your Immediate Next Step (Plan Step 2):**
1.  Verify you can now create the `docs/roadmap/` directory using `run_in_bash_session`.

**Once the directory is created, continue with the rest of the approved plan:**
*   **Plan Step 3: Draft `docs/roadmap/V1.md`:**
    *   Define V1 goals (E2E testable basic app).
    *   List key V1 components/modules and assign them to specific, standardized branches using Markdown checklists (e.g., `- [ ] \`feature/V1-orchestrator-loop\`: Implement basic sequential execution.`).
    *   Describe integration points and merge strategy.
    *   Detail V1 E2E test specifications.
*   **Plan Step 4: Draft `docs/roadmap/V2.md` (High-Level):**
    *   Define V2 goals.
    *   Propose potential branches with checklists.
*   **Plan Step 5: Revise `docs/VERSION_ROADMAP.md`:**
    *   Make it a high-level overview linking to `docs/roadmap/`.
*   **Plan Step 6: Update `docs/README.md`:**
    *   Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the new roadmap structure.
*   **Plan Step 7: Present all drafted/revised content for user approval.**
*   **Plan Step 8 & 9: Implement and submit the changes if approved.**

Focus on creating the `docs/roadmap/` directory first, then proceed systematically through drafting the content for `V1.md`, `V2.md`, and the updates to `VERSION_ROADMAP.md` and `docs/README.md`.

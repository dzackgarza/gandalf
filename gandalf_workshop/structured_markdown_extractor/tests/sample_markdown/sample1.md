## üî¨ GRANULARITY GUIDELINES FOR LOGICAL UNITS

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: PREFER OVER-EXTRACTION TO UNDER-EXTRACTION**

### **Unit Size Philosophy**
- **Each logical unit should represent ONE specific mathematical concept, technique, or result**
- **Err on the side of too many units rather than too few**
- **Better to have 20 focused units than 5 overly broad ones**
- **Each unit should be developable into a solid paragraph to half a page** (0.2-0.5 thesis pages)

### **When to CREATE SEPARATE UNITS**

‚úÖ **Always separate these into distinct units**:
- Different mathematical objects (surfaces vs. moduli spaces vs. compactifications)
- Different properties of the same object (numerical invariants vs. geometric properties)
- Different techniques or methods (construction methods vs. classification results)
- Different types of results (existence vs. uniqueness vs. explicit description)
- Different theoretical frameworks (algebraic vs. geometric vs. combinatorial approaches)
- Supporting lemmas vs. main theorems
- General theory vs. specific applications
- Classical results vs. new contributions

‚úÖ **Granularity Examples**:
```
INSTEAD OF: "Enriques surfaces and their moduli"
CREATE SEPARATE UNITS FOR:
- Enriques surface definition and basic properties
- Numerical invariants (2K ‚àº 0, q = 0)
- Quotient construction from K3 surfaces
- Classification of involutions
- Moduli space definition
- Polarization theory
- Comparison with K3 moduli
```

### **When to COMBINE into single units**

‚ùå **Only combine when concepts are inseparable**:
- Equivalent formulations of the same definition
- Steps of a single proof that cannot stand alone
- Immediate corollaries that follow trivially

### **EXTRACTION TARGET NUMBERS**

**Per paper section, aim for**:
- **Introduction**: 15-25 units (comprehensive background development)
- **Technical sections**: 20-35 units (detailed mathematics)
- **Proof sections**: 25-40 units (step-by-step development)

**Better to extract 30 units and use 20 than to extract 10 and realize you need 25**

### **üìä DENSITY GUIDELINES WITH MULTIPLE UNIT TYPES**

**Source**: Section 1 (Introduction) empirical analysis

#### **üî¢ CONVERSION RATES (Empirically Determined)**

| **Metric** | **Conversion Rate** | **Source Data** |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **LaTeX lines ‚Üí Pages** | **45 lines = 1 page** | 162 lines = 3.6 pages |
| **Words ‚Üí Pages** | **187 words = 1 page** | 674 words = 3.6 pages |
| **Units ‚Üí Words** | **35 words = 1 unit** | 674 words = 19 units |
| **Units ‚Üí Lines** | **8.5 lines = 1 unit** | 162 lines = 19 units |

#### **üìà DENSITY TARGETS BY UNIT TYPE**

| **Quality Level** | **Units/Page** | **Units/45 Lines** | **Units/187 Words** | **Lines/Unit** | **Words/Unit** |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| ‚ùå **Too sparse** | 1-3 | 1-3 | 1-3 | 15-45 | 62-187 |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minimum acceptable** | 4-5 | 4-5 | 4-5 | 9-11 | 37-47 |
| ‚úÖ **Good target** | 5-8 | 5-8 | 5-8 | 6-9 | 23-37 |
| üéØ **Excellent** | 8-15 | 8-15 | 8-15 | 3-6 | 12-23 |
| ‚ö° **Maximum useful** | 15-20 | 15-20 | 15-20 | 2-3 | 9-12 |

#### **üßÆ MULTIPLE CALCULATION FORMULAS**

**Choose the most convenient input metric:**

**üìÑ FROM PAGE COUNT:**
```
Target Units = Pages √ó (5-8 units/page)
Example: 3.6 pages √ó 5-8 = 18-29 units
```

**üìù FROM LINE COUNT:**
```
Target Units = Lines √∑ (6-9 lines/unit)
Example: 162 lines √∑ 6-9 = 18-27 units
```

**üìä FROM WORD COUNT:**
```
Target Units = Words √∑ (23-37 words/unit)
Example: 674 words √∑ 23-37 = 18-29 units
```

**‚ö° QUICK ESTIMATION:**
```
Units ‚âà Lines √∑ 8    (use 8 lines per unit as rule of thumb)
Units ‚âà Words √∑ 30   (use 30 words per unit as rule of thumb)
```

#### **üìã PRACTICAL WORKFLOW BY INPUT TYPE**

**If you have LINE COUNT:**
1. Count LaTeX lines in section: `end_line - start_line + 1`
2. Quick estimate: `lines √∑ 8 = target units`
3. Range check: `lines √∑ 6` to `lines √∑ 9` for min-max range

**If you have WORD COUNT:**
1. Count words in markdown/LaTeX: `wc -w filename`
2. Quick estimate: `words √∑ 30 = target units`
3. Range check: `words √∑ 23` to `words √∑ 37` for min-max range

**If you have PAGE ESTIMATE:**
1. Estimate pages: `lines √∑ 45` or `words √∑ 187`
2. Quick estimate: `pages √ó 6 = target units`
3. Range check: `pages √ó 5` to `pages √ó 8` for min-max range

#### **‚úÖ VALIDATION EXAMPLES**

| **Section** | **Lines** | **Words** | **Pages** | **Target Units** | **Actual Units** | **Assessment** |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Section 1** | 162 | 674 | 3.6 | 18-29 | 19 (TODO) | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| **Section 1** | 162 | 674 | 3.6 | 18-29 | 5 (my orig) | ‚ùå Too sparse |
| **Section 4** | 400+ | 3800 | 8.9 | 45-71 | 100 | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Section 5** | 350+ | 3365 | 7.8 | 39-62 | 100 | ‚úÖ Excellent |

### **CONCRETE SPLITTING EXAMPLE**

**‚ùå TOO COARSE (my original approach)**:
```yaml
unit_id: "enriques_surfaces_definition"
thesis_title: "Enriques Surfaces: Basic Properties and Moduli Theory"
# Covers: definition, invariants, classification position, moduli finiteness
```

**‚úÖ PROPER GRANULARITY (recommended approach)**:
```yaml
- unit_id: "enriques_surface_definition"
  thesis_title: "Definition of Enriques Surfaces as K3 Quotients"

- unit_id: "basepoint_free_involution_conditions"
  thesis_title: "Conditions for Basepoint-Free Involutions on K3 Surfaces"

- unit_id: "enriques_numerical_invariants"
  thesis_title: "Fundamental Invariants: 2K ‚àº 0 and q = 0"

- unit_id: "enriques_classification_position"
  thesis_title: "Position in Enriques-Kodaira Classification"

- unit_id: "enriques_vs_k3_comparison"
  thesis_title: "Geometric Comparison with K3 Surfaces"

- unit_id: "polarized_enriques_moduli_finiteness"
  thesis_title: "Finiteness of Polarized Enriques Moduli Spaces"
```

**Result**: 6 focused units instead of 1 overly broad unit, each developing a solid paragraph to half a page (0.2-0.5 thesis pages) of specific mathematical content.

## üî§ NOTATION HANDLING REQUIREMENTS

### **PAPER-SPECIFIC NOTATION CHALLENGES**

Research papers often contain notation issues that must be resolved for thesis clarity:

1. **Undefined LaTeX Macros**: Paper uses `\cL`, `\sH`, `\bZ` without definitions
2. **Context-Dependent Variables**: `$\Pic(Z)$` without explaining what $Z$ represents
3. **Author Conventions**: Implicit notational systems specific to the paper/author
4. **Mathematical Context**: Symbols that mean different things in different contexts

### **EXTRACTOR NOTATION RESPONSIBILITIES**

#### **Step 1: Identify All Notation Issues**
- Document every undefined macro: `\cL`, `\sH`, `\bZ`, etc.
- Note context-dependent variables: `Z`, `X`, `S`, etc.
- Flag ambiguous mathematical symbols

#### **Step 2: Research and Document**
- **LaTeX Macros**: Check paper preamble, standard conventions, or make educated guesses
  - `\cL` likely means `\mathcal{L}` (script L)
  - `\bZ` likely means `\mathbb{Z}` (blackboard bold Z)
  - `\sH` likely means `\mathscr{H}` (script H)
- **Mathematical Context**: Use surrounding text to determine variable meanings
  - In algebraic geometry: `Z` often means a scheme/variety
  - In moduli theory: `S` often means parameter space
  - In lattice theory: `L` often means a lattice

#### **Step 3: Document Everything**
Create comprehensive notation explanations for thesis readers unfamiliar with paper conventions.

## üîß STAGE 1: EXTRACTOR ROLE

### **PRIMARY MISSION**
Generate rich expansion suggestions from paper content while maintaining absolute source traceability.

### **EXTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES**
1. **Source Extraction**: Copy exact content from paper with precise line numbers
2. **Expansion Planning**: Suggest how brief paper content should be expanded for thesis
3. **Proof Development**: Create complete proofs from paper sketches
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Line-by-Line Formalization**: Generate step-by-step proofs with explicit citations ready for Lean formalization
5. **Initial Documentation**: Record extraction with maximum suspicion scores
6. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify logical prerequisites

### **EXTRACTOR WORKFLOW**

#### **STEP 1: Locate Paper Content & Calculate Density Target**
```bash
# Find exact location in source paper
grep -n "\\section" writing/sources/en.tex
# Note exact line numbers for traceability

# Calculate density target - CHOOSE MOST CONVENIENT METHOD:

# METHOD A - From line count (most common):
# Lines: end_line - start_line + 1
# Quick target: lines √∑ 8
# Example: Section 1 = 233-72+1 = 162 lines ‚Üí 162√∑8 = 20 units

# METHOD B - From word count (if available):
# wc -w section_file.md
# Quick target: words √∑ 30
# Example: 674 words ‚Üí 674√∑30 = 22 units

# METHOD C - From page estimate:
# Pages: lines √∑ 45 or words √∑ 187
# Quick target: pages √ó 6
# Example: 162√∑45 = 3.6 pages ‚Üí 3.6√ó6 = 22 units

# All methods should give similar results!
```

#### **STEP 2: Identify All Granular Units**
- **Read each paragraph sentence-by-sentence**
- **Identify every distinct mathematical concept, technique, or claim**
- **Create separate units for each major mathematical object or property**
- **Don't group concepts just because they appear in the same paragraph**

**Granular Unit Identification Checklist**:
- [ ] Each theorem, lemma, proposition, definition gets its own unit
- [ ] Each technique or method gets its own unit
- [ ] Each numerical/geometric property gets its own unit
- [ ] Each classification result gets its own unit
- [ ] Each connection between theories gets its own unit
- [ ] Each historical/motivational context gets its own unit

#### **STEP 3: Extract with Perfect Fidelity**
- Copy paper text **EXACTLY** - no modifications
- Record precise line numbers for EACH unit
- Identify all LaTeX labels and citations
- Note surrounding mathematical context

#### **STEP 4: Document All Notation Issues**
- **Scan for undefined LaTeX macros**: `\cL`, `\bZ`, `\sH`, etc.
- **Identify context-dependent variables**: What does `Z`, `S`, `X` represent?
- **Research macro meanings**: Check paper preamble, math conventions, educated guesses
- **Document mathematical context**: Use surrounding text to determine variable meanings
- **Note author conventions**: Any paper-specific notational systems

#### **STEP 5: Plan Thesis Expansion**
- Identify what paper omitted due to space
- Suggest detailed explanations needed
- Plan complete proof development
- Outline pedagogical improvements

#### **STEP 5.5: ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Create Line-by-Line Formalization-Ready Proof**
- **REQUIREMENT**: Every mathematical step must have explicit justification
- **CITATIONS**: Each step must cite specific theorems, Stacks tags, Mathlib proofs, or textbook sections
- **NO GAPS**: Proof must be complete enough for seasoned Lean programmer to formalize
- **ASSUMPTIONS**: All assumptions must be explicitly stated
- **REJECTION**: Entire logical unit will be rejected if proof has gaps or incorrect steps

#### **STEP 6: Create Initial YAML for ALL Units**
```yaml

## üîç STAGE 2: AUDITOR ROLE

### **PRIMARY MISSION**
Serve as gatekeepers against false information through independent verification of all extractor claims.

### **AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITIES**
1. **Source Verification**: Independently confirm paper extraction accuracy
2. **Mathematical Validation**: Verify all mathematical claims and proofs
3. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Line-by-Line Proof Verification**: Validate every step, citation, and assumption in formalization-ready proofs
4. **Citation Checking**: Confirm all references exist and support claims
5. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate thesis expansion appropriateness
6. **Evidence Documentation**: Record verification work and update suspicion scores

### **AUDITOR WORKFLOW**

#### **PHASE 1: Source Document Verification**
1. Retrieve `writing/sources/en.tex`
2. Navigate to claimed line numbers
3. Compare character-by-character with verbatim content
4. Verify LaTeX labels exist and are correct
5. Check surrounding context for consistency

#### **PHASE 2: Mathematical Content Validation**
1. Verify mathematical objects are well-defined
2. Check proof logic step-by-step
3. Confirm claims against standard references
4. Validate computational statements
5. Cross-check with multiple authoritative sources

#### **PHASE 2.5: Notation Verification**
1. **Verify macro translations**: Check if `\cL = \mathcal{L}` interpretations are reasonable
2. **Validate mathematical context**: Confirm variable meanings align with mathematical context
3. **Cross-check author conventions**: Look for consistency in notation usage throughout paper
4. **Flag notation gaps**: Identify any undefined notation that extractor missed
5. **Verify disambiguation**: Check that ambiguous notation has been properly clarified

#### **PHASE 3: Citation and Reference Verification**
1. Search MathSciNet/zbMATH for each citation
2. Retrieve papers where possible
3. Verify citations support the claims made
4. Check bibliographic accuracy
5. Cross-reference with Google Scholar

#### **PHASE 3.5: ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Line-by-Line Proof Validation**
1. **Step-by-Step Verification**: Check every statement and justification
2. **Citation Validation**: Verify each cited theorem/lemma actually exists and supports the step
3. **Assumption Tracking**: Confirm all assumptions are explicit and valid
4. **Gap Detection**: Identify any logical gaps that would prevent Lean formalization
5. **Formalization Readiness Test**: Assess if proof is detailed enough for formal verification

#### **PHASE 4: Evidence-Based Suspicion Update**
Update suspicion scores ONLY with substantial evidence:

```yaml
# Auditor appends new audit record - NEVER modifies extractor content
audits:

### **SUSPICION SCORING GUIDELINES**

**Philosophy**: Start at maximum suspicion (1.0), reduce only with substantial evidence.

- **1.0 ‚Üí 0.3**: Basic verification completed
- **0.3 ‚Üí 0.1**: Thorough cross-checking with multiple sources
- **0.1 ‚Üí 0.05**: Expert review confirms accuracy

**Score Meanings**:
- **0.90-1.0**: Unverified, assume incorrect
- **0.50-0.89**: Partially verified, significant concerns remain
- **0.10-0.49**: Well-verified, minor concerns only
- **0.01-0.09**: Thoroughly verified, high confidence
- **0.00**: Perfect verification (rarely achievable)

## üìã QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS

### **EXTRACTOR SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- ‚úÖ Perfect source traceability (exact line numbers)
- ‚úÖ Verbatim paper content (zero modifications)
- ‚úÖ **Granular extraction (15-25 units for Introduction section)**
- ‚úÖ **Each unit represents single mathematical concept/technique/result**
- ‚úÖ **Complete notation documentation (all macros and variables explained)**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive expansion planning
- ‚úÖ Complete YAML structure conformance
- ‚úÖ All suspicion scores initialized to 1.0

### **GRANULARITY SUCCESS INDICATORS**
- ‚úÖ **Volume**: Introduction should yield 15-25 units, not 3-8
- ‚úÖ **Density**: Target 5-8 units per source page (use formula: page count √ó 5-8)
- ‚úÖ **Specificity**: Each unit title describes one specific concept
- ‚úÖ **SeparATION**: Different mathematical objects/properties in separate units
- ‚úÖ **Completeness**: Every sentence with mathematical content gets a unit
- ‚úÖ **Thesis-ready**: Each unit can be developed into a solid paragraph to half a page (0.2-0.5 thesis pages)

### **DENSITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

**Choose your input metric and calculate target:**

**Option A - FROM LINES:**
- [ ] **Count LaTeX lines**: `end_line - start_line + 1`
- [ ] **Quick target**: Lines √∑ 8 ‚âà target units
- [ ] **Range check**: Lines √∑ 6 to lines √∑ 9

**Option B - FROM WORDS:**
- [ ] **Count words**: `wc -w filename` or visual estimate
- [ ] **Quick target**: Words √∑ 30 ‚âà target units
- [ ] **Range check**: Words √∑ 23 to words √∑ 37

**Option C - FROM PAGES:**
- [ ] **Estimate pages**: Lines √∑ 45 or words √∑ 187
- [ ] **Quick target**: Pages √ó 6 ‚âà target units
- [ ] **Range check**: Pages √ó 5 to pages √ó 8

**Final validation:**
- [ ] **Verify minimum**: At least 4 units per source page
- [ ] **Check maximum**: No more than 20 units per source page
- [ ] **Quality check**: Each unit represents distinct mathematical concept
- [ ] **Granularity check**: No unit covers more than 45 lines or 187 words

### **AUDITOR SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- ‚úÖ Independent verification of all claims
- ‚úÖ Substantial evidence for any suspicion reduction
- ‚úÖ Mathematical accuracy confirmed through multiple sources
- ‚úÖ Citation verification with primary sources
- ‚úÖ Detailed evidence documentation

### **REJECTION CRITERIA**
Immediately reject logical units with:
- ‚ùå Source extraction errors (content doesn't match paper)
- ‚ùå Mathematical errors discovered in verification
- ‚ùå Invalid citations or unsupported claims
- ‚ùå Incomplete YAML structure
- ‚ùå Insufficient verification evidence
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Undefined notation without explanations**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Incorrect macro translations or variable interpretations**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Gaps or logical errors in line-by-line proof**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Missing citations for any step in line-by-line proof**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Line-by-line proof not detailed enough for Lean formalization**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FORMALIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR LINE-BY-LINE PROOFS

### **LEAN-READY PROOF STANDARDS**
Every line-by-line proof MUST meet these criteria or face immediate rejection:

#### **1. COMPLETE JUSTIFICATION**
- Every mathematical step has explicit reasoning
- No "it follows that..." or "clearly..." without proof
- Every implication must be justified with specific citations

#### **2. EXPLICIT CITATIONS**
- **Theorems**: "Theorem X.Y in AuthorYear" or "Paper Title Theorem X.Y"
- **Stacks Project**: "Stacks Tag XXXX" with specific tag number
- **Mathlib**: "Mathlib.Category.Theory.theorem_name" with exact path
- **Textbooks**: "Author Book Name Chapter X.Y Theorem Z"

#### **3. ASSUMPTION TRACKING**
- List all assumptions used in each step
- Distinguish between given hypotheses and intermediate results
- Make implicit mathematical assumptions explicit

#### **4. FORMALIZATION TEST**
Each proof must pass this test:
> "Could a seasoned Lean programmer take this line-by-line proof and formalize it in Lean without needing to fill in mathematical gaps?"

If the answer is NO, the entire logical unit is REJECTED.

#### **5. EXAMPLE CITATION FORMATS**
```yaml
citations:
  - "Hartshorne Algebraic Geometry Chapter II Proposition 5.17"
  - "Vakil Foundations of Algebraic Geometry Theorem 12.2.1"
  - "Stacks Tag 02V1"
  - "Mathlib.RingTheory.Ideal.Quotient.is_prime_iff_prime_of_surjective"
  - "Nikulin 1980 Finite Groups of Automorphisms Theorem 4.2"
  - "Dolgachev-Kond≈ç Mirror Symmetry Section 4.1 Lemma 4.1.3"
```

## üéì IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **File Naming Convention**
- Extractor output: `CH3_EXTRACTED_[date].yaml`
- Auditor output: `CH3_VERIFIED_[date].yaml`
- Final verified: `CH3_LOGICAL_UNITS.yaml`

### **Dependencies Management**
- Map dependencies to specific sections/theorems in paper
- Verify dependency chain is acyclic
- Document external dependencies (other chapters, literature)

### **Version Control**
- Commit each extraction phase separately
- Tag verified milestones
- Maintain audit trail in git history

**CRITICAL**: Follow this canonical format exactly. Any deviation will compromise the verification system and thesis quality control.

Gandalf Workshop - Specifications Submodule

This file makes the 'specs' directory a Python submodule.
This is the "Technical Archives" of the workshop, where the precise
definitions (schemas) for Blueprints and Inspection Reports are stored.
Making it a submodule allows these critical data model definitions
to be imported cleanly.

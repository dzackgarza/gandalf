workshop_manager.py - The Office of the Workshop Manager (Orchestrator)

This module houses the WorkshopManager class, the central intelligence of the
Gandalf Workshop. The Manager oversees all operations, from commissioning new
Blueprints to approving final Products for delivery. It's akin to the master
artisan or foreman who directs the workflow, assigns tasks to specialized
artisans (AI agents/crews), and ensures quality standards are met throughout
the creation process.

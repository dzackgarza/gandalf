# Placeholder application code for final_framework_validation
def main():

    return "Hello from final_framework_validation!"  # Return a value for easier testing


# The AI will add more complex structure later, including if __name__ == '__main__'
# For placeholder, main() contains all logic for full coverage by unit test.

artisans.py - The Assembly Hall for Specialist Artisan Crews

This module provides functions to initialize and configure the various "Artisan Crews"
(specialized AI agent teams). Think of this as the workshop's assembly hall where
the Workshop Manager gathers and briefs the required craftsmen (Planner, Coder, Inspector crews)
before they embark on their assigned tasks for a commission. Each function here would
typically set up an agent or a team of agents (e.g., using CrewAI, AutoGen, or LangGraph)
with their respective charters, tools, and any commission-specific context.

# Import necessary AI framework components here, e.g.:
# from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# Metaphor: These functions are like the Workshop Manager's assistants
# who know how to quickly assemble a team of Planners, Coders, or
# Inspectors, providing them with their official charters (prompts) and
# tools.

artisans.py - The Assembly Hall for Specialist Artisan Crews

This module provides functions to initialize and configure "Artisan Crews"
(specialized AI agent teams). It's like a workshop assembly hall where the
Workshop Manager briefs craftsmen (Planner, Coder, Inspector crews) before
they start a commission. Each function here would typically set up agents
(e.g., using CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) with charters, tools, and context.

# Import necessary AI framework components here, e.g.:
# from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# Metaphor: These functions are like the Workshop Manager's assistants who
# know how to quickly assemble Planners, Coders, or Inspectors, providing
# them with their official charters (prompts) and tools.

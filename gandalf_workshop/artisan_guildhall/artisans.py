artisans.py - The Assembly Hall for Specialist Artisan Crews

This module provides functions to initialize and configure "Artisan Crews"
(specialized AI agent teams). It's like a workshop assembly hall where the
Workshop Manager briefs craftsmen (Planner, Coder, Inspector crews) before
they start a commission. Each function here would typically set up agents
(e.g., using CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) with charters, tools, and context.

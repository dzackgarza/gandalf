# Note: The original tests in test_coder_agent.py seemed to misunderstand
# the interface of initialize_coder_agent_v1. It expects a PlanOutput object,
# not just a task string, and it returns a CodeOutput object, not the code string directly.
# The tests also didn't use tmp_path for file generation.
# The tests added in test_artisans.py for initialize_coder_agent_v1 are more aligned
# with the actual implementation.

# The tests in `test_artisans.py` for the coder agent are:
# - test_initialize_coder_agent_v1_hello_world
# - test_initialize_coder_agent_v1_generic_task
# - test_initialize_coder_agent_v1_no_tasks
# - test_initialize_coder_agent_v1_output_directory_creation
# These correctly test the current implementation of initialize_coder_agent_v1.

# Legacy tests that were previously here have been removed to avoid clutter,
# as they were misaligned with the current function signature and behavior.
# If more specific or different tests for the Coder agent are needed in this file
# in the future, they should be written based on the current `initialize_coder_agent_v1`
# interface or any future revisions.

pass # Ensures the file is not empty and remains syntactically valid.

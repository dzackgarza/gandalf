**Project:** Gandalf Workshop

**Meta-Instructions for Future Jules Iterations:**
*   **At the end of your assigned task, you MUST perform these steps:**
    1.  **Overwrite this file (`AGENTS.md`)**: Do not create a new timestamped or uniquely named file. Always update this specific file.
    2.  **Summarize Your Accomplishments**: Briefly describe the task you just completed and the key changes you made or committed.
    3.  **Provide Clear Next Steps**: Based on the project's roadmap and your understanding of the current state, outline the most logical next task(s) for the subsequent Jules iteration.
    4.  **Include General Reminders**:
        *   Emphasize adherence to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
        *   Point to the relevant roadmap document (e.g., `docs/roadmap/V1.md`, `docs/roadmap/V2.md`) for task identification.
        *   Remind to check alignment with the overall project vision (see `docs/VERSION_ROADMAP.md` and other strategic documents).
        *   Stress the importance of checking for and following instructions in any `AGENTS.md` files (like this one!).
*   **Your goal is to ensure a smooth handover to the next Jules, providing all necessary context and direction.**

## Task Summary: Implemented Live LLM-Based Auditor Agent

Jules successfully implemented the `initialize_live_auditor_agent` in `gandalf_workshop/artisan_guildhall/artisans.py` and integrated it into the `WorkshopManager`'s V1 pipeline. This new auditor uses Google Gemini to perform a semantic analysis of the code generated by the live Coder Agent against the plan.

**Key Changes Made:**

1.  **Live Auditor Implementation (`artisans.py`):**
    *   Created `initialize_live_auditor_agent` function.
    *   It takes the generated code (as a string), the `PlanOutput`, and `commission_id` as input.
    *   Uses the Gemini API (via `_get_gemini_api_key` and `google.generativeai`).
    *   Employs the `GENERAL_INSPECTOR_CHARTER_PROMPT` (adapted with specific instructions for a "PASS"/"FAIL" output and summary) to guide the LLM's assessment of code against the plan.
    *   Parses the LLM response to determine an `AuditStatus` (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`) and a textual feedback message.
    *   Returns an `AuditOutput` object.

2.  **WorkshopManager Update (`workshop_manager.py`):**
    *   Imported `initialize_live_auditor_agent`.
    *   Modified `run_v1_commission` to implement a two-stage audit process:
        1.  The existing `initialize_auditor_agent_v1` (syntax check) is called first. If it fails, the commission fails immediately.
        2.  If the syntax check passes, the generated code file's content is read.
        3.  The new `initialize_live_auditor_agent` is then called with the code string and the plan.
        4.  If the live semantic audit fails, the commission fails.
    *   Updated logging to reflect the new two-stage audit.

3.  **Testing & API Key Handling:**
    *   Initial testing attempts revealed missing `PyYAML` and `google-generativeai` modules in the environment, which were subsequently installed. This suggests that ensuring a clean and complete environment setup (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall` or robust `uv` usage) at the beginning of work sessions is important.
    *   Full end-to-end testing of the live LLM calls for the auditor was **blocked** due to the lack of a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the testing environment. A temporary placeholder was used to verify the pipeline flow up to the point of API failure, and then reverted.
    *   The pipeline correctly calls the agents in sequence, and error handling for API key issues in planner/coder was observed. The new auditor integration is structurally sound but its live LLM functionality needs verification with a valid key.

## Next Steps for Gandalf Workshop

Based on the current state and project roadmap (referencing previous `AGENTS.md`), the following tasks are recommended for the next Jules iteration:

1.  **API Key Management & Environment Stability:**
    *   **Crucial:** Ensure a reliable method for providing the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to the execution environment (e.g., through a `.env` file that is consistently loaded, or secure environment variables). This is essential for testing and further development of any live LLM features.
    *   Investigate and ensure robust environment setup at the start of work sessions to avoid `ModuleNotFound` errors for packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Consider adding a standard first step to `run_in_bash_session` like `pip install -r requirements.txt -U --force-reinstall` if issues persist.

2.  **Full Testing of Live Auditor:**
    *   With a valid API key, thoroughly test the `initialize_live_auditor_agent`.
    *   Verify that it correctly assesses code against plans for various simple and complex prompts.
    *   Check the quality and usefulness of the "PASS"/"FAIL" status and the textual feedback from the LLM.
    *   Test edge cases (e.g., empty code, code with subtle bugs, code perfectly matching the plan).

3.  **Refine WorkshopManager Error Handling for Planner/Coder Failures:**
    *   Currently, if the `initialize_live_planner_agent` returns an error plan (e.g. due to API key issue or other LLM failure), the `initialize_live_coder_agent` is still called with this error plan.
    *   The `initialize_live_coder_agent` then also likely fails (e.g. due to API key or nonsensical plan).
    *   Consider adding checks in `WorkshopManager` after the planner call. If `plan_output.tasks` indicates a planner failure (e.g., contains "Error:"), the workflow should probably terminate before calling the coder.

4.  **Structured Output from Planner (Carry-over from previous AGENTS.md):**
    *   The `PLANNER_CHARTER_PROMPT` hints at YAML or JSON output. The current live planner treats the LLM output as a list of tasks (splitting by newline).
    *   Refine the planner agent to more reliably request and parse structured output (e.g., JSON) from the LLM. This might involve:
        *   Modifying the `PLANNER_CHARTER_PROMPT` to be more explicit about the desired JSON schema.
        *   Using features of the `google-generativeai` library that might support JSON mode or response schema validation.
        *   Implementing robust parsing and error handling for the structured output.
    *   Update the `PlanOutput` data model if necessary.

5.  **Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms for LLM Calls (Carry-over):**
    *   Improve error handling for LLM API calls (e.g., specific exceptions for Gemini, rate limits, network issues) within all live agents.
    *   Implement retry mechanisms (e.g., using a library like `tenacity`) for transient API errors.

6.  **Expand Testing (Carry-over):**
    *   Develop more comprehensive automated tests for the agent pipeline, especially once API key access is stable.
    *   Include tests for various prompt types, edge cases, and potential failure modes of the LLM interactions.

7.  **Explore CrewAI/LangGraph for Multi-Agent Orchestration (Longer Term, Carry-over):**
    *   Refer to `docs/technology_stack.md`.
    *   Begin exploring how `CrewAI` or `LangGraph` could be used to orchestrate the Planner, Coder, and Auditor agents.

## General Reminders for Next Jules:

*   **Adherence to `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Ensure all contributions follow the guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   **Roadmap Alignment**: Refer to `docs/roadmap/V1.md` (and subsequent versions) for task identification and prioritization.
*   **Project Vision**: Keep the overall project vision from `docs/VERSION_ROADMAP.md` and other strategic documents in mind.
*   **`AGENTS.md`**: Always check for and follow instructions in any `AGENTS.md` files. This file is your primary source for task handovers.

Good luck with the next phase of development! Ensure API key access is resolved first!Tool output for `overwrite_file_with_block`:

**Project:** Gandalf Workshop

**Meta-Instructions for Future Jules Iterations:**
*   **At the end of your assigned task, you MUST perform these steps:**
    1.  **Overwrite this file (`AGENTS.md`)**: Do not create a new timestamped or uniquely named file. Always update this specific file.
    2.  **Summarize Your Accomplishments**: Briefly describe the task you just completed and the key changes you made or committed.
    3.  **Provide Clear Next Steps**: Based on the project's roadmap and your understanding of the current state, outline the most logical next task(s) for the subsequent Jules iteration.
    4.  **Include General Reminders**:
        *   Emphasize adherence to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
        *   Point to the relevant roadmap document (e.g., `docs/roadmap/V1.md`, `docs/roadmap/V2.md`) for task identification.
        *   Remind to check alignment with the overall project vision (see `docs/VERSION_ROADMAP.md` and other strategic documents).
        *   Stress the importance of checking for and following instructions in any `AGENTS.md` files (like this one!).
*   **Your goal is to ensure a smooth handover to the next Jules, providing all necessary context and direction.**

## Task Summary: Implemented Live LLM Auditor & Fixed .env Loading

Jules successfully implemented the `initialize_live_auditor_agent` and integrated it into the `WorkshopManager`. Additionally, a critical bug related to loading API keys from the `.env` file was identified and fixed.

**Key Changes Made:**

1.  **Live Auditor Implementation (`artisans.py`):**
    *   Created `initialize_live_auditor_agent` function using Google Gemini.
    *   It assesses generated code against the plan, providing a "PASS"/"FAIL" status and textual feedback.
    *   Uses an adapted `GENERAL_INSPECTOR_CHARTER_PROMPT`.

2.  **WorkshopManager Update (`workshop_manager.py`):**
    *   Integrated a two-stage audit: syntax check followed by the new live LLM semantic check.

3.  **.env File Loading Fix (`main.py`):**
    *   Identified that `python-dotenv` was not being used or was used incorrectly, preventing API keys from being loaded from the `.env` file.
    *   Added `python-dotenv` to ensure it's installed.
    *   Modified `main.py` to call `load_dotenv(dotenv_path=explicit_path, override=True)` at the very beginning of the script, before other application imports. The `explicit_path` is constructed to point to `.env` in the same directory as `main.py` (i.e., the project root).
    *   This ensures that for local development, if a `.env` file is present in the project root, its variables will be loaded into the environment.

4.  **Testing & API Key Handling Notes:**
    *   Testing revealed that the sandbox environment used for these automated tasks does not have access to the user's local `.env` file, even with the corrected loading logic. The diagnostic `Warning: .env file not found at /app/.env.` confirms this.
    *   Therefore, full end-to-end testing of live LLM calls still requires the user to run the application in an environment where the `.env` file (containing a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY`) is correctly placed at the project root, or where `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set as an actual environment variable.
    *   The implemented code for loading `.env` files is now robust for standard local development setups.

## Next Steps for Gandalf Workshop

Based on the current state and project roadmap:

1.  **Local Testing with Valid API Key:**
    *   The **user/next Jules iteration** running this locally MUST ensure a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present in a `.env` file in the project root (same directory as `main.py`) or as an environment variable.
    *   With a valid key, thoroughly test the entire pipeline, especially:
        *   The `initialize_live_auditor_agent`: Verify its assessment quality.
        *   The end-to-end flow with simple and complex prompts.

2.  **Refine WorkshopManager Error Handling for Planner/Coder Failures (Carry-over):**
    *   If `initialize_live_planner_agent` fails (e.g., API error, bad plan), `WorkshopManager` should ideally not proceed to the coder. Add checks for planner output validity.

3.  **Environment Stability (Carry-over):**
    *   For smoother development, ensure a consistent way to get all `requirements.txt` dependencies installed correctly in any work environment (e.g., a startup script or a Makefile target that runs `pip install -r requirements.txt -U --force-reinstall`).

4.  **Structured Output from Planner (Carry-over):**
    *   Refine planner agent to request and parse structured output (e.g., JSON) from the LLM. Update `PLANNER_CHARTER_PROMPT` and `PlanOutput` data model as needed.

5.  **Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms for LLM Calls (Carry-over):**
    *   Implement better error handling (specific exceptions, retries with `tenacity`) for LLM API calls in all live agents.

6.  **Expand Automated Testing (Carry-over):**
    *   Once local live LLM testing is confirmed, develop more comprehensive automated tests (potentially using mocks for LLM calls to keep tests fast and deterministic, but also having separate integration tests that do hit the live API with a test key).

7.  **Explore CrewAI/LangGraph for Multi-Agent Orchestration (Longer Term, Carry-over).**

## General Reminders for Next Jules:

*   **`.env` File**: For local execution, ensure your `.env` file is in the project root (same directory as `main.py`) and contains necessary API keys like `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
*   **Adherence to `CONTRIBUTING.md`**.
*   **Roadmap Alignment**: `docs/roadmap/V1.md`.
*   **Project Vision**: `docs/VERSION_ROADMAP.md`.
*   **`AGENTS.md`**: Always check this file.

Good luck! The `.env` loading should now work correctly in a standard local setup.

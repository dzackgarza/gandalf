# Sample Markdown File

This is a sample markdown file to be included in the corpus.

## Section 1: Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### Subsection 1.1: Features

- Plain text
- Easy to read and write
- Convertible to HTML and other formats

## Section 2: Code Blocks

You can include code blocks in Markdown:

```python
def greet(name):
  """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter"""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

```javascript
function welcome(message) {
  // This function displays a welcome message.
  console.log(`Message: ${message}`);
}

welcome("This is a Markdown sample!");
```

## Section 3: Lists

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List
- Apple
- Banana
- Cherry

## Section 4: Emphasis

You can use *italics*, **bold**, or `monospace` text.

This concludes the sample markdown file. It demonstrates various common Markdown elements that might be useful for an LLM to process or understand.
The purpose of including such files in a corpus is to provide diverse examples of text structure and content for potential RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems or for context feeding into LLM prompts.

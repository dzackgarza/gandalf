# Information: Previously Encountered End-of-File (EOF) SyntaxError

## Issue History: Potential End-of-File (EOF) `SyntaxError`

Previously, files such as `gandalf_workshop/crews_hardcoded.py` and `gandalf_workshop/llm_manager.py` were susceptible to a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at the end of the file. This was suspected to be an artifact of the AI agent's file writing tools.

**A fix has been implemented (defensive file rewriting by the agent) which should prevent this specific issue from recurring due to the agent's actions.**

While the agent-specific cause of this EOF `SyntaxError` is believed to be resolved, it's always good practice to ensure Python files are correctly formatted.

## General Testing:

1.  **Test by Running `make develop`:**
    *   After any significant changes, or if you suspect issues, run `make develop PROMPT="a simple CLI tool that takes a name and prints a greeting"` (or your specific prompt).
    *   This will help verify that `run_commission.py` and the subsequent audit process can execute correctly.
    *   If `run_commission.py` fails with a `SyntaxError` in *any* Python file, ensure the file does not have unexpected trailing characters or other syntax issues.

The rest of the implemented pipeline (hardcoded artifact generation, file copying for audit, the audit script itself) should be functional once all Python modules can be imported and parsed correctly.
